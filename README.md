# Spect-System-Review
SPECT stands for Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography
## Objective

such as depression, suicidal ideation, Autism, seizures impact on the brain, ADHD, ADD, anxiety, and trauma. 
Overall making the SPECT as psychological tool for daily clinical purposes [Source: Ramandeep et al., 2022].
## Main goal of the research: 
“An advantage here to call for SPECT technology is that more
the half-life of the tracer, the imaging will be easier and cheaper as compared to other
imaging technologies available. Cheaper technology likely have more advantages to be used
